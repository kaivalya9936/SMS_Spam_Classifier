# SMS_Spam_Classifier

This is a Jupyter notebook that compares various machine learning algorithms and classifies an SMS as spam or not. The dataset used in this notebook contains labeled SMS messages, which are used to train and test the different models.

### The notebook starts by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This includes various visualizations such as word clouds, which give a deeper understanding of the data. The EDA also includes data preprocessing and cleaning steps to prepare the data for modeling.

### After EDA, several machine learning models are trained and tested on the dataset. These models include:

1.Logistic Regression - a statistical method that we can use to fit a regression model when the response variable is binary.
2.Support Vector Machine - a supervised learning model that can be used for classification or regression tasks.
3.Multinomial Naive Bayes - a probabilistic algorithm based on the Bayes theorem with an assumption of independence among features.
4.Decision Tree Classifier - a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
5.K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier - a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
6.Random Forest Classifier - an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
7.AdaBoost Classifier - an ensemble learning method that creates a strong classifier from a set of weak classifiers.
8.Bagging Classifier - an ensemble method that uses bootstrap aggregating to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression.
9.Extra Trees Classifier - a variant of Random Forest, where randomness is injected in both feature and sample selection.
10.Gradient Boosting Classifier - an ensemble method that creates a strong classifier from a set of weak classifiers.
11.XGBoost Classifier - an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.


### After training and testing the models, their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The notebook concludes with a comparison of the performance of the different models, and highlights the model with the best performance.
